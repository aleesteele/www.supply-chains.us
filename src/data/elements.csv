Aluminium,"The most abundant metal element in Earth’s crust. Aluminum originates as an oxide called alumina. Bauxite ore is the main source of aluminum and must be imported from Jamaica, Guinea, Brazil, Guyana, etc. Used in transportation (automobiles), packaging, building/construction, electrical, machinery and other uses.

","Aluminum has many applications in industries such as transportation, packaging, construction and electrical transmission. In the transportation industry, the most common use on aluminum is as sheets, tubes, and casting. Automobiles, trains, and aircraft all use aluminum in their exteriors. In regards to packaging, many food and beverage containers are made of aluminum and the main reason for this is because the metal does not corrode. This allows the food container to last much longer. In addition to packaging and transportation related uses, the construction industry also relies heavily on aluminum since doors, windows and roofing can all use this metal. As far as electrical transmission is concerned, transmission lines often use aluminum as oxidation is not an issue.",,"Silicon metal is absolutely necessary to the production of aluminium and chemical products since it provides them with essential properties. A wide range of modern technologies depend on this material.

Indonesia is focusing on the development of two nickel-based battery blends – nickel-cobalt-manganese, and lithium-cobalt-nickel-aluminium – two of the most widely used combinations for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles today, Lie said.

The U.S. was 87 percent import reliant in 2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Barium,"A heavy metal contained in barite. Used as a heavy additive in oil well drilling; in the paper and rubber industries; as a filler or extender in cloth, ink and plastics products; in radiography (“barium milkshake”); as a deoxidizer for copper; a sparkplug in alloys; and in making expensive white pigments.",,China,,"According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) the world's top importer of barium sulphate (barytes) is the United States, who imports 26% of the world's barium sulphate.",,"Mining methods used to extract baryte vary depending on the type, shape and depth of the deposit. Major bed deposits are usually mined using the open pit method. The baryte is drilled and blasted with explosives and then taken out using front end loaders and other heavy industry vehicles. Vein deposits of baryte are mined using shafts, horizontal passages and sometimes shallow open pits. Residual deposits of baryte are worked on by hand due to the irregular nature of baryte mineralization. Witherite is usually found in fairly pure form and is associating with baryte or other minerals in low temperature hydrothermal environments. Since this is the case witherite is extracted along with these other minerals. Regardless of the extraction method used the mined baryte and witherite are then loaded onto trucks to be taken to factories or labs for processing.","Since baryte is highly impure and has contaminants, such as waste rock and other minerals, it is processed after being mined. The baryte is separated from these contaminants by gravity separation, wet grinding and froth flotation. Then the baryte is dried. Baryte is turned into barium sulphate by the process of carbothermal reaction, which means that it is heated with coke. For highly pure barium sulphate to be produced barium sulfide is treated with sulfuric acid or salts. Barium carbonate is made commercially and in labs by treating barium sulfide with sodium carbonate using the soda ash method. The barium carbonate that is created from this process is then filtered, washed and dried to finish processing it.","Barium sulphate is a health hazard to the eyes and respiratory system, can give off toxic fumes in a fire and can react with aluminum powder to create an explosion. When being handled it protective gloves, googles and clothing should be worn to prevent contact. It should be stored in tightly closed containers, in a well ventilated area away from materials it could react with. It is usually transported via truck, rail or in tanks and should be stored at 77°Fahrenheit (25° Celsius). Barium carbonate is a health hazard is swallowed, can give off toxic fumes in a fire and can react with acids to generate a fire. Protective gear should also be used when handling it. It should be separated from any food, foodstuffs, acids and bromotrifluoride when being transported. It is transported via truck, rail, boat or airplane and is stored in a similar way to barium sulphate.","Barium sulphate is mostly used as a component in drilling fluid for oil wells. It is used for this since it adds to the density of the drilling fluid, which reduces the chance of a blowout of oil happening from the well. Barium sulphate is also one of the components that makes up white pigment for paints, as a coating for certain photogenic papers and as a filler for plastics. It is also used as a radiocontrast agent when in suspension for x-ray imaging and in green pyrotechnic formulas. Barium carbonate is mostly used in the glazes for the ceramics industry since is acts as a flux and can produce unique colors. It is also added to clay to precipitate away salts that would coat the clay's surface.",,,,,

While mining companies – Glencore, Freeport-McMoran, Asarco and other producers have cut production, Rio Tinto, one of the biggest, has announced that it will do no such thing. In fact, Rio and BHP Billiton have gone in the other direction, increasing production of their principal commodities, including copper, expanding output in their worldwide mining operations.","Copper is useful in many applications, but the primary use is in electrical wiring.

Quartz is extracted by open pit mining, which involves extracting minerals from a burrow. Most of the time mining operations involve using bulldozers and backhoes to remove the soil and clay around the quartz to expose to the surface. On rare occasions, miners have to use explosives when the quartz they need to expose is deep underground. This extraction is done rarely because quartz can be damaged easily if suddenly exposed to a change in temperature, which an explosive blast would cause. Either way, once the quartz is exposed to the surface, it takes a team possessing small hand tools like chisels or picks to extract the quartz from the quarry. ","Once quartz is mined it must undergo an extensive cleaning process to strip off physical flaws or chemical impurities. After being cleaned, the quartz is screened and then crushed into various sizes depending on its future use. Quartz goes through a process of being crushed by a crusher and then it is separated by a vibrating screen. Next, it is ground by a ball mill and lastly classifying into different sizes by the classifier. Quartz powder is manufactured by crushing the pure lumps quartz up into a fine powder bu using a grinder mill.",/,"Quartz has many different and various applications.
