Transport,Multiple,General,,Cargo Liquefaction,"Over the past debade, more than half of the lives lost on cargo ships at sea has been due to cargo liquefaction, a process that turns solid state cargo into a liquid state, which can shift the ship's hold and destabilise the vessel. If the cargo returns to a material state, this can make the tilt permanent, putting the ship and its crew at risk of sinking.",,,,,,https://splash247.com/cargo-liquefaction-the-cause-of-over-half-of-all-deaths-on-dry-bulk-vessels-in-the-past-decade/,https://theconversation.com/mystery-of-the-cargo-ships-that-sink-when-their-cargo-suddenly-liquefies-101158

,,General,,Seafarer Abandonment: The Seafarer Abandonment Project,"Cargo ships may be abandoned by their owners if they run into financial problems or if abandoning the vessel is less costly than continuing to operate it. Abandoning a ship also means abandoning any crew still finishing a contract on that vessel, and ceasing to pay crew wages. Abandoned seafarers are left in a catch-22 as their right to the paid their wages from the sale of the vessel is tied to them staying on board. In some cases, leaving may be technically possible but would constitute the loss of a key bargaining chip for claiming unpaid wages. In other cases, seafarers whose passports have expired while at sea or remain with their employer, are at risk of detention if they were to set foot on land. Finally, ships at sea without crew have been prohibited by international maritime law as they are a safety hazard, leading to situations where seafarers are effectively held hostage as leaving the ship would be tantamount to breaking the law. 

In one of the most recent cases of seafarer abandonment, the Panama-flagged MT Iba was grounded just meters from a beach in the United Arab Emirates. The vessel was abandoned by its owners and crew had not been paid their wages for 32 months. In February 2021, after 43 months at sea, the seafarers are returning home following a wage settlement.
